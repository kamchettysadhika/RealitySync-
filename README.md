RealitySync is an AI-powered coordination system designed for real-time retail operations.

It connects edge devices, inventory streams, and anomaly detection pipelines to a centralized backend that makes intelligent decisions and immediately alerts the right teams. When outages or anomalies are detected (like low inventory or suspicious transactions), RealitySync generates an AI-driven action plan and sends it to the appropriate Slack channelsâ€”automatically.

Field crews can respond using simple Slack commands like /checkin <location>, and the backend keeps track of responses, interventions, and resolution timelines. This removes the need for manual dispatching, reduces downtime, and keeps operational awareness high across teams.

While the frontend is still under development, the backend and Slack integration are fully functional and production-ready. RealitySync is ideal for organizations that need fast, AI-enhanced field coordination with minimal friction and maximal visibility.
